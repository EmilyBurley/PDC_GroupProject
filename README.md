# Group Project  
###### By Emily Burley, Xia Chen, Christina Marogi, Jessalyn Hilliard-Steed  

### Project Context  

This is the group project for the Parallel and Distributed Computing class taught by Dr. Debnath at Oakland University.

### Overview  

The objective of this project is to perform a computation in both an unparallelized and parallelized manner, and then compare the performance of the two approaches.  

### Files  

There are two program files: "unparallelized.c" and "parallelized.cu". Both files are written in C, but "parallelized.cu" is a CUDA file.  

### Computation  

Both files perform matrix multiplication. The file "unparallelized.c" performs unparallelized matrix multiplication, and the file "parallelized.cu" performs parallelized matrix multiplication.
